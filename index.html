      <u><h2 class="career-heading">CAREER</h2></u>
      <p class="career-paragraph">
        ‚ùáÔ∏è In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group.
        He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary National Radio and
        Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic
        slowdown.<br /><br />
        ‚ùáÔ∏è In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming
        him his successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads
        of various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational freedom
        under the senior Tata's tenure.<br /><br />
        ‚ùáÔ∏è In response, Tata implemented a number of policies designed to
        consolidate power, including the implementation of a retirement age,
        having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring
        subsidiaries to contribute their profit to building the Tata group
        brand. <br /><br />
        ‚ùáÔ∏è Tata prioritised innovation and delegated many responsibilities to
        younger talent. Under his leadership, overlapping operations between
        subsidiaries were streamlined into company-wide operations, with the
        group exiting unrelated businesses to take on globalisation.<br /><br />
        ‚ùáÔ∏è During the 21 years Tata led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40
        times, and profit over 50 times.When he took over the company, sales
        overwhelmingly comprised commodity sales, but at the end of his tenure,
        the majority of sales came from brands.<br /><br />
        ‚ùáÔ∏è He had Tata Tea acquire Tetley, Tata Motors acquire Jaguar Land
        Rover, and Tata Steel acquire Corus. These acquisitions repositioned
        Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with
        over 65% of revenues coming from operations and sales
        internationally.<br /><br />
        ‚ùáÔ∏è He also conceptualized and spearheaded the development of the Tata
        Nano car, which helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the
        average Indian consumer.Tata Motors has since rolled out the first batch
        of Tigor Electric Vehicles from its Sanand Plant in Gujarat, which Tata
        has described as "fast-forward[ing] India's electric dream.
